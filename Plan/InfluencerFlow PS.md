## Problem Statement

Influencer marketing is growing rapidly, but the process remains highly manual, inefficient, and fragmented. Brands and agencies struggle with discovering the right creators, reaching out at scale, negotiating deals, handling contracts, tracking performance, and processing payments - often across spreadsheets, emails, and WhatsApp. This leads to missed opportunities, slow turnarounds, inconsistent pricing, and a poor experience for both creators and marketers.

On the other side, creators - especially in emerging markets face language barriers, delayed payments, and unclear expectations, as most lack professional management. There is no unified platform that brings automation, Al, and personalization to streamline this ecosystem.

The industry needs a scalable solution that can manage high volumes of campaigns while delivering speed, accuracy, and fairness. We aim to solve this by building an Al-powered platform that automates the entire influencer marketing workflow - from creator discovery and outreach to negotiation, contracts, payments, and performance reporting - with multilingual communication and human-like Al agents that can scale personalized interactions.
